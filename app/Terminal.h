// that RUNS the result when `execute` is set.
//
// More than a concatenation, in three ways. A newline inside pasted text is a
// carriage return on the command line, which is how hterm's own paste handler
// writes it. When the mode is on the payload is filtered of the control
// characters that could end the bracket early -- an \e[201~ smuggled inside a
// snippet would otherwise hand everything after it to the shell as typed input,
// which is a command the user did not choose to run -- keeping the same
// whitespace (\b \t \n \r) that xterm and hterm keep. And the execute
// newline goes OUTSIDE the closing bracket: inside, the shell takes it as
// literal text in the pasted block and the line never runs at all, which is the
// whole point of bracketing.
