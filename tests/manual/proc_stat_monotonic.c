/*
 * proc_stat_monotonic -- /proc/stat's CPU counters must never go backward,
 * and must add up to the time that passed.
 *
 * AOK synthesizes /proc/stat's cpuN lines by bucketing each guest task into a
 * virtual-CPU slot (pid % ncpu): live tasks are sampled on every read, and
 * do_exit "banks" an exiting task's final thread time into per-slot dead
 * totals (kernel/task.c). The banking was not serialized against the reader:
 * a task exiting mid-read could be counted twice in one snapshot -- sampled
 * live during the task-list walk AND included via the dead-slot totals it
 * banked just before the reader loaded them. That read reported an inflated
 * user/system value, and the next read dropped back down: a backward-moving
 * counter, which a real kernel never produces.
 *
 * top-style tools assume monotonicity. ktop computed `cur - prev` on
 * unsigned long long, so one backward tick became a ~2^64 delta, the meter
 * fraction became astronomical, the cell count saturated to INT_MAX, an
 * overflow-broken clamp (`used + cells[i]`) failed to catch it, and the bar
 * fill loop read its text buffer thousands of bytes past the end -- straight
 * off the top of the stack at 0xfffff000. Crashed regularly under multi-arch
 * chroot churn (many short-lived exits). Fixed by cpu_slots_lock in
 * kernel/task.c (plus defensive clamps in ktop itself).
 *
 * IDLE is checked too, on every cpuN line and on the aggregate "cpu" line.
 * It used to be exempt, because AOK derived it as "uptime minus busy" and
 * uptime was whole seconds of wall clock: busy time grows continuously, so
 * between two reads in the same second idle SHRANK. A waybar survey measured
 * idle going backward in 65 of 74 samples taken 50 ms apart (native Linux: 0
 * of 80), and waybar's cpu module takes its first reading from two samples
 * 100 ms apart, so that reading was garbage. The same subtraction also let
 * idle fall whenever a slot's busy time outran the clock -- several busy tasks
 * in one slot, or the process using more cores than it reports -- which is
 * why the second phase below runs more spinners than there are CPUs.
 *
 * And the fields have to ADD UP: over a phase, each line's total should grow
 * by about the elapsed time (times ncpu for the aggregate line). Holding idle
 * flat while busy runs ahead would keep every field monotonic and still
 * report a CPU that did two seconds of work per second.
 *
 * Also passes on real Linux (counters there are monotonic by construction).
