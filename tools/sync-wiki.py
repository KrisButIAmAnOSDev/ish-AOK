"""Publish opt/AOK/docs to the iSH-AOK GitHub wiki, without losing edits made there.

    tools/sync-wiki.py               # report only: say what would change, touch nothing
    tools/sync-wiki.py --push        # publish, and push
    tools/sync-wiki.py --adopt       # accept the wiki's current text as the baseline

WHY THIS IS NOT A COPY LOOP.

A GitHub wiki is a git repository people can edit through the web UI, and this
one already has been: `Home.md` carries a hand-written "Developer Instructions"
document that exists nowhere in opt/AOK/docs, and `Crypto-Acceleration.md` had
drifted 318 diff lines from crypto-accel.md before this script existed. A plain
publish would have destroyed both.

So every page carries a recorded fingerprint of what this script last published
(docs/.wiki-sync). On each run a page is in exactly one of four states:

  new        no such wiki page          -> create it
  unchanged  wiki text == what we published last time, and the doc has not
             changed either                                  -> nothing to do
  ours       wiki text == what we published last time, but the doc has changed
                                                              -> safe to update
  DIVERGED   wiki text != what we published last time         -> somebody edited
             the page. Reported with a diff and SKIPPED.

DIVERGED is the whole point. Those edits are somebody's work, and the fix is to
carry them back into opt/AOK/docs -- the docs are compiled into the app and
served at /AOK/docs, so the repo has to be the source of truth or the shipped
copy silently rots. Once that is done the page publishes cleanly on the next
run. `--adopt` is the escape hatch for a page whose wiki text is already the one
you want to keep: it records the fingerprint without changing anything, so the
page stops being reported and the NEXT doc change will overwrite it.

Home.md is never rewritten. Only the block between the two index markers is
replaced, and if they are absent the page is left alone and reported.
